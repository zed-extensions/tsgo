# tsgo: Native TypeScript Compiler Integration for Zed

This extension integrates `tsgo`, Microsoft's native Go-based TypeScript compiler, into the Zed editor, delivering enhanced performance and efficiency for TypeScript development.

## üöÄ Why `tsgo`?

Microsoft is transitioning the TypeScript compiler from its JavaScript implementation to a native version written in Go, aiming for significant performance improvements:

- **Faster Compilation**: Achieves up to 10x speed improvements in large projects.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Optimized memory handling in native execution.
- **Improved Editor Performance**: Faster IntelliSense and language services.
- **Scalability**: Better handling of large codebases.

> _Example Benchmarks_:
>
> - **VS Code**: 77.8s ‚Üí 7.5s (10.4x speedup)
> - **Playwright**: 11.1s ‚Üí 1.1s (10.1x speedup)
> - **TypeORM**: 17.5s ‚Üí 1.3s (13.5x speedup)

## üõ† Installation

1. Open Zed's Extensions page.
2. Search for `tsgo` and install the extension.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

_Note_: `tsgo` is currently in preview and may not support all features of the standard `tsc` compiler.

### Basic Setup

Enable `tsgo` in your Zed settings:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "TypeScript": {
      "language_servers": ["tsgo"]
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use `tsgo` in tandem with other language servers (e.g. `typescript-language-server` or `vtsls`). Zed will use `tsgo` for features it supports and fallback to the next language server in the list for unsupported features.
To do that with `vtsls`, use:

```json
{
  "languages": {
    "TypeScript": {
      "language_servers": ["tsgo", "vtsls"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Specifying a Package Version

By default, the extension installs and uses the latest version of the `@typescript/native-preview` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@typescript/native-preview?activeTab=versions). To pin a specific version:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "tsgo": {
      "settings": {
        "package_version": "7.0.0-dev.20251029.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is useful for:

- Ensuring consistent behavior across the project
- Testing specific versions
- Avoiding automatic updates that might introduce issues

## üß™ Status

This extension is in early development stages. While it offers significant performance benefits, some features may be incomplete or unstable. Contributions and feedback are welcome to improve its functionality.
